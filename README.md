## Matrix

## InnerProduct
Partially implemented
* Implemented Standard Inner Product
* Implemented isInnerProduct that checks if the given function is an inner product (the result is not with absolute certinaty. e.g: if you get a false value it is certianly not an inner product but a true value not neccessearly indicates it is)
